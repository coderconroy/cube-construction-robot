    abstractNote={Investment in an industrial robot (IRb) is stimulated by applications that demand easy changes to achieve various tasks. If the shape of the object to be handled varies for each different task then the gripper must also be changed. Thus versatility is required and in this chapter a number of sketches and photographs of prototypes which have been built and tested, possible other solutions and possibilities have also been gathered as follows:},
