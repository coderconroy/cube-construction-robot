    abstractNote={Investment in an industrial robot (IRb) is stimulated by applications that demand easy changes to achieve various tasks. If the shape of the object to be handled varies for each different task then the gripper must also be changed. Thus versatility is required and in this chapter a number of sketches and photographs of prototypes which have been built and tested, possible other solutions and possibilities have also been gathered as follows:},

@article{Wei2020,
   abstract = {In this article, a novel, efficient grasp synthesis method is introduced that can be used for closed-loop robotic grasping. Using only a single monocular camera, the proposed approach can detect contour information from an image in real time and then determine the precise position of an object to be grasped by matching its contour with a given template. This approach is much lighter than the currently prevailing methods, especially vision-based deep-learning techniques, in that it requires no prior training. With the use of the state-of-the-art techniques of edge detection, superpixel segmentation, and shape matching, our visual servoing method does not rely on accurate camera calibration or position control and is able to adapt to dynamic environments. Experiments show that the approach provides high levels of compliance, performance, and robustness under diverse experiment environments.},

   abstract = {The shapes of plant leaves are very important to plant ecologists and botanists because these can help distinguish plant species as well as serve as health indicators. In this paper, we present a novel contour-based shape descriptor named multiscale triangular centroid distance (MTCD) for plant leaf recognition. MTCD features at different triangles are extracted from each contour point to provide a compact, multiscale shape descriptor. Both local and global features of a plant leaf are effectively captured by the proposed method. A simple cosine distance is used to calculate the dissimilarity measurement between MTCD descriptors. Therefore, MTCD is a rapid approach for shape matching and is suitable for real-time application. The proposed method has been evaluated using four publicly available plant leaf datasets, including the Swedish Leaf dataset, the Smithsonian Leaf dataset, the Flavia Leaf dataset, and the ImageCLEF2012 Leaf dataset. The experimental results show that this novel approach can achieve high recognition accuracy. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art shape-based plant leaf recognition methods further demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MTCD.},
