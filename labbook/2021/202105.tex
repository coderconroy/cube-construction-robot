This section presents the inital draft of the experimental plan required to demonstrate conformance to the system specifications. Prior to the commencement of any of the qualification tests, the following setup steps must have been completed:

\begin{compactenum}
    \item Ensure robotic manipulator's workspace is completely empty.
    \item Power on the PC that will run the system control software.
    \item Ensure the system camera has a clear view of the system workspace and connect the camera to the PC.
    \item Connect the robotic subsystem to the PC.
    \item Power on the robotic subsystem.
    \item Start the system control software on the PC and verify a connection is established with the camera and robotic subsystem.
    \item Initialise the system calibration process using the system control software GUI and verify the calibration completes successfully.
