\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Interpretation of results}

\subsection{Critical evaluation of the design}

- 3D printed X-axis assembly comes loose over time - look into linear rails instead
- Z-axis motor mount relies on friction between linear rods to pull rods and entire z-axis assembly. The plastic wears and becomes loose over time leading to slippage - correct this by incorporating a clamping mechanism into the design

\subsection{Design ergonomics}

- Robust as the rigid structure facilitates easy transportation with no disturbance to the structure

\subsection{Health, safety and environmental impact}

\subsection{Social and legal impact of the design}

%% Potential improvements
%% - Used an improved approach to solve the PnP and estimate the extrinsic matrix
