% Mechanical component of robotic system


% Robotic system motor control


% Embedded robot controller


% Object detection


% Classical image processing techniques

%- Contour detection is only concerned with outer border detection but does use the approach of border labeling over border marking
%- In this implementation, once the fiducials have been detected and the bounding region has been formed, it is assumed that all remaining contours are cubes or are a collection of cubes due to the constrained nature of the region of interest (ROI).


% Object and robot localisation


% Computer graphics
