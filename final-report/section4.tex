Let the lower plane be denoted by $z_{lower}$ and the upper plane be denoted by $z_{upper}$. Select these values as $z_{lower}=500$ and $z_{upper}=2300$ steps.
	\item Position the robotic end-effector such that the tip of the mechanical pencil touches the sheet of paper on the vertical stand surface firmly enough to leave a mark on the paper. Record the x- and y-position in steps as $x_{mark}$ and $y_{mark}$ respectively.
	\item Move the robotic end effector to ($x_{mark}$ - \textit{offset}, $y_{mark}$, $z_{lower}$) where \textit{offset}=50 steps when the vertical stand is facing left and \textit{offset}=-50 steps when facing right.
	\item Set the x-position of the robotic end-effector to $x_{mark}$ to mark the point on the paper.
	\item Set the x-position of the robotic end-effector to $x_{mark}$ - \textit{offset} to remove the pencil tip from the paper.

	\item Click on the \textit{Load model} button and select the \textit{.cubeworld} an arbitrary 30 cube test shape file.
	\item Clear the \textit{Robotic Subsystem's} workspace and place the 30 cubes at the pre-defined \textit{source cube} locations.
	\item Click on the \textit{Start Construction} button in the system control software to initiate the construction process.
	\item For each of the first 5 cubes, click the \textit{Release Actuator} button in the system control software to force the robot to drop the cube while carrying the cube to the structure.
	\textit Note whether the robot detects the dropped cube condition before in the GUI info log before proceeding with construction.
	\item For cubes 6 to 10, manually remove the cube from the grip of the end-effector during the robot's final downward movement to place the cube and place the cube in the robot's workspace.
	\item Note whether the robot detects the dropped cube condition before in the GUI info log before proceeding with construction.
	\item Repeat steps 5 to 6 with cubes 11 to 15, but remove the cube during the robot's horizontal motion while moving the cube to the structure.
	\item Repeat steps 5 to 6 with cubes 16 to 20, but remove the cube during the robot's upward motion after gripping the cube.
	\item Repeat steps 5 to 6 with cubes 21 to 25, but remove the cube while the robot is moving to grip the cube.
	\item After the 25th cube has been placed, push the structure under construction until at least 1 cube falls from the structure.
	\item Note whether the system detects a construction failure condition using the GUI info log.
	\item Repeat steps 1 to 11 with a different test shape structure until 5 iterations have been completed.
