	\textbf{Task} & \textbf{Progress} & \textbf{Brief description} \\ \hline
	Construction of mechanical component of robotic subsystem & 50\% complete & All the custom mechanical components have been manufactured by means of 3D printing which is the most time-consuming aspect of this task. The v-slot aluminium extrusions, chromed steel rods, linear rails and lead screw need to be cut to length. All the components need to be assembled. \\ \hline
	Development of vacuum generation mechanism & 10\% complete & A syringe actuated by a DS3118MG digital servo motor has been selected as the vacuum generation mechanism and both of these components have been acquired. A mechanical link between the servo and syringe needs to be designed and manufactured by means of 3D printing. \\ \hline
	Development of camera and lighting mount for robotic subsystem & 10\% complete & The base aluminium extrusion onto which the lighting and camera will be mounted has been included in the robotic subsystem design. Components to connect the lighting and camera to the extrusion need to be designed and manufactured by means of 3D printing. \\ \hline
	Development of embedded controller hardware for robotic subsystem & 20\% complete & The STM32L072RZT6 has been selected as the base processing platform and procured. Four DRV8825 stepper motor drivers have been acquired. The drivers have been tested using the Arduino Nano development board, Wantai 35BYG312P1 stepper motor and GF240-1H-AM 12V/20A power supply unit. A schematic integrating all electrical components needs to be designed and prototyped. \\ \hline
	Development of firmware for embedded controller for robotic subsystem & 0\% complete & Firmware needs to be written to communicate with the PC-based software as well as to control the robotic subsystem's motors and monitor its sensors. \\ \hline
