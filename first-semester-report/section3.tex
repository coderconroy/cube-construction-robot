\section{Project plan (second semester)}

The project plan for semester two is outlined in Figure 1 below. The plan consists of five phases. The first phase is the robotic subsystem mechanical component development phase, in which the mechanical construction of the robotic subsystem will be completed. The second phase is the robotic controller development phase, in which the hardware and firmware for the robotic subsystem will be developed. The third phase is the PC-based software development phase, in which the PC-based software containing the computer vision, shape definition and robotic route planner components will be developed. The fourth phase is the system finalisation phase, in which any lingering issues will be addressed and the system tested. Finally, the reporting phase consists of the writing and submission of the final report. All of the phases overlap to some degree.
